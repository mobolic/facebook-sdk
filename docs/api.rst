class facebook.GraphAPI
=======================

A client for the Facebook Graph API. The Graph API is made up of the objects or
nodes in Facebook (e.g., people, pages, events, photos) and the connections or
edges between them (e.g., friends, photo tags, and event RSVPs). This client
provides access to those primitive types in a generic way.

You can read more about `Facebook's Graph API here`_.

.. _Facebook's Graph API here: https://developers.facebook.com/docs/graph-api

**Parameters**

* ``access_token`` – A ``string`` that identifies a user, app, or page and can
  be used by the app to make graph API calls.
  `Read more about access tokens here`_.
* ``timeout`` - A ``float`` describing (in seconds) how long the client will be
  waiting for a response from Facebook's servers. `See more here`_.
* ``version`` - A ``string`` describing the `version of Facebook's Graph API to
  use`_. The default version is the oldest current version. It is used if
  the version keyword argument is not provided.
* ``proxies`` - A ``dict`` with proxy-settings that Requests should use.
  `See Requests documentation`_.
* ``session`` - A `Requests Session object`_.
* ``app_secret`` - (optional) A ``string`` representing the secret key of your
  app. If both ``app_secret`` and ``access_token`` are present this will be
  used to compute an `appsecret_proof`_
